# AI-ML-projects

The Purpose of this repository is to Publish some of my Essential AI/ML learning topics with their code

### Career Goals, Studies and Projects:
My current career goal is to focus on my learning and solidifying the foundational knowledge required to work as an Artificial Intelligence / Machine learning engineer. I have mapped out these areas of knowledge that I intend to study further, and I aim to become a technical expert in the field.

I started my career in the domain of Business Intelligence and Data Analyst field. I learned and utilized my Data engineering skills using MS SQL, MS Power BI, MS SSIS, MS Azure Datafactory, Tableau and Cloud platform like MS Azure, AWS, Oracle BI Cloud etc.
 
Now I am transitioning myself in the field of Artificial Intelligence / Machine learning.

Currently in my AI-Ops diploma I am doing hands on in Bash and Python skills in a domain of ML and AI. Also continue learning different skill sets which are essential for this domain.
Key Areas I am highly interested in and wish to explore further within the fields of artificial intelligence and data science include: development operations around large language models (LLMs), model quantization techniques, inference optimization for large models, pipeline orchestration involving model processes, LLM explainability, structuring security processes in training and evaluation pipelines, ethics, epistemology, statistical validation of model experiments, statistics and statistical inference, among others.
